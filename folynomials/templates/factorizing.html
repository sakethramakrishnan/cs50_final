<h1>Solving Quadratics by Factorizing</h1>
<h2>Factorizing involves breaking down the polynomial into simpler terms that can be multiplied to get the original polynomial. Follow these steps:</h2>
<ol dir='left'>
    <li dir='left'>Write the polynomial in standard form.</li>
    <li>Identify common factors and group terms.</li>
    <li>Use factoring techniques such as factoring by grouping, difference of squares, or trinomial factoring.</li>
    <li>Set each factor equal to zero and solve for the roots.</li>
</ol>
<br>
<br>
<h4>For example, to factorize the polynomial \( x^2 - 5x + 6 \), we find:</h4>
<p>\[
x^2 - 5x + 6 = (x - 2)(x - 3)
\]</p>
<p>Setting each factor to zero gives us the roots:</p>
<p>\[
x - 2 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x - 3 = 0
\]</p>
<p>Thus, the solutions are \( x = 2 \) and \( x = 3 \).</p>
